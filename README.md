COSMIC DEFENDERS TUTORIAL:



Cosmic Defenders is a videogame made by me for a school project. 
All the code is builded in python and i tried to learn how to use the kivy module. The first app you have to run is "Cosmic Defender.py", 
there will be after opening the program 5 buttons:
FACILE, MEDIO, DIFFICILE, README, GITHUB.
with FACILE, MEDIO, DIFFICILE you can set up the game's difficulty and with Github you'll get to this profile and with readme the README.md will open.
The game is simple, you are a red turtle that has to shoot the enemies coming from the sky.
I'll leave you the source if you wanna add something.
